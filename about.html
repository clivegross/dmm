    <h2>ABOUT DMM</h2>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <P>
    We are a Pty Ltd company and started
    here in Mandurah Ocean Marina precinct in March 2008. My partner Kristine and I
    bought the business at this time. We have arguably improved the operation in ways
    that have enhanced our reputation and ability to service customers needs. One of the
    best changes was the name change from Commercial Marine Maintenance to Diesel
    Marine Maintenance DMM. This change more accurately reflects what we do, and, it was
    a good thing to get away from the previous operations name.

    The boat yard structure that we work within is a little unusual in that we have
    designated roles regarding type of work done. The yard has a Marine Trimmer,
    Shipwright, Electronics supply/installer, a Petrol and sterndrive/outboard repairer and
    us, whose role is to service and repair diesel engines, reverse gear, shafts rudders and
    other systems. We don’t do petrol or stern drives. We do operate on saildrives and
    IPS. Nick Amps at Total Marine Repairs(TMR) is in accord with the above. We frequently
    work with TMR on combination jobs with diesel sterndrive. The yard can be a one stop
    shop because any work not catered for by business’s within the yard, such as high
    voltage elec, aircon/refrigeration and stainless/ally fab work can be easily sourced locally
    and done on site.

  <h2>The Team</h2>
  <p>
    Our work force has undergone change like all mechanical business, in mining booms.
    Our work force now consists of myself and 2 apprentices. We have a unique TAFE
    training course in place where our apprentices do the Marine Mechanic course at
    Challenger TAFE and in the last year they go to Polytechnic at Thornlie where they
    undergo electronic diesel engine maintenance and forced induction systems. This
    is a good rounding off to suit our work situation. We are extremely lucky with our
    apprentices who both have a good outlook on life and both have good work ethics.
