    <h1>MANDURAH BOAT YARD</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    The yard has a Marine Trimmer, Shipwright, Electronics supply/installer, a Petrol and sterndrive/outboard repairer and us, whose role is to service and repair diesel engines, reverse gear, shafts rudders and other systems.   We don’t do petrol or stern drives.  We do operate on saildrives and IPS.     The yard can be a one stop shop because any work not catered for by business’s within the yard, such as high voltage elec, aircon/refrigeration and stainless/ally fab work,  can be easily sourced locally and done on site.
